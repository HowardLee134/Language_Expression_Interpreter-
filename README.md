# Language_Expression_Interpreter
## Project Name: Language Expression Interpreter 
## Description: 
Developed and implemented a robust interpreter for a high-level programming language, consisting of three essential components: Scanner, Parser, and Evaluator.

Engineered a highly efficient scanner module capable of meticulously analyzing a continuous stream of characters, intelligently identifying and extracting the expression to be assessed.

Designed and implemented a cutting-edge parser module that seamlessly transforms the processed character stream into a meticulously crafted Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), representing the underlying code structure with utmost precision and accuracy.

Crafted a sophisticated evaluator component, leveraging the power of the AST, to dynamically execute and evaluate the code, ensuring optimal performance and adherence to language specifications. Effectively handled tokenization and parsing complexities to deliver accurate and efficient results.

Developed a robust and scalable solution, meticulously optimized for performance, that meets the stringent requirements and industry standards demanded by leading tech companies.
